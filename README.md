# spmjs.io

`spmjs.io` is the distributed packaging server perfectly matching with [spm@3.x](https://github.com/spmjs/spm/tree/master). Now it is rewrited in javascript from [Yuan](https://github.com/spmjs/yuan/)(the precursors), and is faster, more powerful and easier to deploy.

## Install

```bash
$ git clone git://github.com/spmjs/spmjs.io.git
$ cd spmjs.io
$ npm install
```

## Config

Modify `config/base.yaml` as you need.

## Deploy

Start and stop server by a simple command.

```bash
$ npm run start
```

```bash
$ npm run stop
```

Then you have a complete package source server which can interact with [spm3.x](https://github.com/spmjs/spm/tree/master) after add the server address to `~/.spm/spmrc-3x`.

```ini
[source:default]
url = http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

Reindex the packages for elastic search.

```bash
$ npm run reindex
```
